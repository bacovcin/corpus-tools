Taken from Beatrice Santorini:

Uppercase letters indicate genres that are probably formal; lowercase letters ones that are probably informal. See notes for unclear cases.
This category was introduced as a proxy for closeness to/distance from the vernacular. We retain it even though it is not a very good proxy.
